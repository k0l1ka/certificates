Some of my certificates. 

Among them:

- Bachelor Diploma (French translation with the original) - contains my grades for all the courses I took during my BSc program in Applied Mathematics and Physics (and Informatics in fact) at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://eng.mipt.ru/)

- Hackathon "GenHack" participation certificate - I was training Wasserstein GAN model to enable sampling synthetic data from the same distribution as in the given dataset. A small (~800 rows) dataset of absolute values of log-returns for 4 stocks was used to train the model.

- AI summer school participation certificate - I was watching the lectures of experts in such areas as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and ML in general.
